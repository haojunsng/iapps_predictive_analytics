Kindly ignore my previous reply.
Can we check if the assessment for stage 6 or 2? Based on the screenshot all student are going for stage 2. As the Theory and practical stage are not matched, result will not reflect in the portal. You may either get student to do stage 2 online test or request to amend all student stage to stage 6.

Thank you.
With Best Regards,
Azimah

"Dear iAPPS,

We would like to request IPA file for ActiveSG POS and ActiveSG Stripped POS app, in order to whitelist the app to be used on CMs/ACMs' GoMAX devices.

Reason to request due to CMs/ACMs unable to access ActiveSG POS and ActiveSG Stripped POS app as when they launch the app but no response.

Upon checked with GoMAX team and been advised by following:
The error falls under GoMAX restriction; trusting enterprise apps not allowed.
In order for the app to be trusted on GoMAX, Agency requestor should raise SR Publish Mobile Application.
When GoMAX deploy apps from Airwatch, we sign the app from enterprise end. The app developer should provide a working IPA file for the supported iOS/iPAD OS device models.

Seeking your assistance please.

"Hi Dear Sir/Madam,

I have a tennis court booking at Farrer Park tennis Centre court 01 11-12am
on 6th March (my ID:S8776224F). I already paid but cannot go any more.

I called the centre and was told I can just call or write in to cancel for
refund once I decide to cancel.

But I just called in and got told that I cannot cancel.

Is it true? This no cancellation policy is not reasonable at all,
especially am cancelling 5 days before the event. Not allowing users to
cancel would be a waste of my money and also a waste of resources for other
people who can come to play at that time.

Please advise and I hope you can understand my situation and facilitate the
refund.

Many thanks,
Yingtao

"Hello,

I have made a booking for squash 2 March 5pm at Kallang Squash Centre (please see email below).
However, as I am currently feeling unwell, I do not think it is advisable for me to continue on with the booking and to free up the slot to others. 

I have called the main hotline and Kallang Squash Centre earlier just now and henceforth sending the email to request for cancellation and refund if possible.

Please kindly advise.

Thank you,

",SwimSafer
"I am using ActiveSG app for gym facilities booking.  I had trying to book
whenever it's open for booking, I got the slot but the app goes ""loading""
for more than 20 over mins without any response.. so as I had to backward
click to get out of the ""loading"" loops. And after tat I try rebook again
but all the slots had been taken.

I had checked, my hp location is always on. Is there any other settings I
have to turn on before I do the booking?

"Hi Helpdesk We have checked and this account's practical score is failed.

In future, for such cases to check eCert, please help to verify:
1. Helpdesk to check in POS/admin panel if participant has an account in
activesg & created date is before practical score.
2. Then if no. 1 not ok, ask Participant to ask who is their coach and ask
them to verify if they have pass or fail. Failed accounts will not have
eCert.

We have checked and the certificate has been generated and tagged already
to this child account.
Please ask user to try again

In future, for such cases to check eCert, please help to verify:
1. Helpdesk to check in POS/admin panel if participant has an account in
activesg & created date is before practical score.
2. Then if no. 1 not ok, ask Participant to ask who is their coach and ask
them to verify if they have pass or fail. Failed accounts will not have

"Hi, I’ve read that ActiveSG will be suspending members who do not turn up for three or more gym/pool bookings will have their membership suspended for two weeks. May I ask wether by three or more bookings, is it collectively or 3 in a row? Because I wanted to cancel my Gym Booking at Jurong Lake Gym on 1 March 2021 but I couldn’t and I am scared that I would get suspended. I tried to cancel at around 12:56pm for my slot at 3pm and I couldn’t. I wasn’t feeling well on that day. Is there anything you could do for me?

We have verified all entries are correct, and upon clicking ""Sign Up"" after
filling in all details, the error ""Invalid Entry (Identity Number)"" appears.

Kindly advise what is the issue related to this. Thank you.

"Hi,

I have added my child’s information to my ActiveSG account and I’m able to switch to my child profile and back to my profile in my phone. 

When my wife tried adding child profile in her ActiveSG using her phone the PR id field always throw error as invalid id for my child and able to proceed further.

We just wanted to add our child profile to both of our ActiveSG apps so that it’ll be helpful when we take turns in taking our child to swimming class and pay the entry using ActiveSG account for our child. 

Please clarify how we can add our child profile to both of our ActiveSG app accounts. Thanks.

"Hi.

I've just received notification that my badminton court booking has been
cancelled and my account has been suspended.
Prior to this, yishun sports hall centre manager, Ms Rachel, spoke to me
and ask for clarification on my bookings and I explain to her there's no
profit in it and more of get together with friends.

After explaining, I dont understand why the cancellation and banned of my
account?
How do you justify this?
Perhaps a sit down or meet up would make you have better understanding of
my games with friends.

Also, the booking fee was refunded to my activesg account but I can't log
in to my account.
If the account remain suspended at the moment, wouldn't it be right for you
to refund the money back to my bank account?

I hope to hear from you soon as its extremely unfair for you to be banning
account without proper investigation. There are many others out there who
are making money put of this, even coaches.
Sadly me and many others are being banned without any justification or
explanation.

Please help.

"Hi,

 

If you accept booking for gyms to be purchased 4 days earlier, please also
allow the monthly gym pass to be purchased in advance. Else, it does not
make sense.

 

For example, I want to purchase a gym slot on Friday released today, but I
have to pay $2.50 for the slot because I am unable to purchase a monthly
pass that starts on Friday only on Friday itself.

 

And by the time I purchase the monthly gym pass on Friday, all the slots
would have been gone.

Thanks.

 


I remain your humble and obedient servant,

Subject: Change of Swimsafer Assessment of Student (Corporation Primary School)

Dear Jayme & Farris,

I am Mr Ong, HOD PE of Corporation Primary School.

My P4 students are currently undergoing swimsafer 2.0 and I would like to request in a change of assessment for 1 of my students under assessment code: ORLKBKVR.


1)      Name: Chin Jia Hao Bryan               Class: 3.2

I understand from my vendor, Sttitude swim school that they will not be able to make any further changes upon published.

I seek your understanding as I was only recently updated by the parent of his child’s swimming proficiency.

To serve better meaning and purpose for the child, I seek your understanding and help to allow the above mentioned child, Bryan to take an assessment that is relevant to his competency (Swimsafer Stage 4, Bronze).

I look forward to hear from you soon.

Warmest Regards,

We recently booked the assessment for swimming. 

 

However, we realize for one of the classes that had mixed levels, the below highlighted should be level 5 instead of level 6. 

 

Could you please assist to amend their level from 6 to 5.

"Dear Sir,

I have booked a tennis court for 2 hours for the 4th March at Kallang.
Due to unavailability of other member, I would like to cancel the booking
so the slots are freed up to someone else who want to use.
I do not require any refund, just want to help release the court.
It would be appreciated if you could cancel the booking.
My receipt number is 20210220RC017801.

I once tried and failed to cancel the other booking, being told that with
the current system they can not do. If that is still the case, I really
think someone should bring up the case to enable it, even if people don’t
get any refund.

Thank you for your assistance.

Thank you for your quick response and clarification. I didn’t know that. Is
there any possibility of reinstating the credits?

 Hi,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.


It might be due to credit has already expired. Do take note upon successful
verification you will have to use the credit at least once a year if not it
will expired as system did not capture any transaction within each year.

"To whom it may concern,

My name is Sashikumar Mohan and I am a registered member of h.p. 94259767.
I have booked 2 slots which are on the 2nd March and 3rd March 2021.

I regret to inform you that I will not be in the Badminton court on:

* 2 Mar - 2100 to 2200hrs - Court 04
* 3 Mar - 2100 to 2200hrs - Court 08

as I am injured and unable to engage in any form of sports activities.

Please find attached the medical certificate from NUH as evidence. I may
not be able to engage in sports activities anytime soon. Hence, I humbly
request you a refund for the above-mentioned slots.

Christopher Leong
Christopher.leongth@gmail.com

Hi Jun Jie,



Thanks for the fast reply.

I further wish to point out that the system traffic is too overwhelming and

it took me 8 mins to actually go in a book a slot. Worst, as I wait and

refresh I see slots number getting smaller and smaller. This enhancement

you and Janice elaborated to me in the previous emails are just pure

nonsense.



I was expecting to have a smooth booking experience but this is really too

much. The government encourage Singaporean to exercise more but how to

exercise more when your system don't allow me to book the gym slot?



I don't know to count myself extremely lucky or what, as I waited for YOUR

system to load I manage to book the 2nd last slot for 7pm. My group of

friends not so lucky.



Please get your team to look into this issue as I'm not the only one not

being satisfied with this server issue of yours. ""Monitoring"" is an

understatement as it had been days.



Looking forward to hearing from you.



Sincerely,

"Good day Sport Singapore

I am writing to you regarding about the double verification that is currently ongoing while visiting Clementi ActiveSg gym. There will be a post setup just outside of the sports hall, the main entrance that is. After going through normal temperature screening and checking in, there will be another checks done right at the gym entrance. I suggest to do away with the secondary checks as its a waste of my time for both myself and the gym staff.
Thank you for hearing to my suggestion and all of the gym patrons hope that Sports Singapore will look into the matter.

"Hi,

I tried to book again for this Sunday (for 11am at Heartbeat at Bedok gum) when your system opens for booking at noon today (a few minutes ago) but I couldn’t. See in the attached, the same problem. There is certainly some problem with your system which allows only a few to book facilities or they are circumventing some or one of your system to go through to book which your tech team isn’t able to solve.

There were also other classes that we were interested in but not able to
book as they were for 7yrs old and above.  My child is a 2014 baby.  Does
that mean i have to manually call every centre to book as i cant book via

I just received message telling me that my booking for 7 and 14 March has been cancelled due to courts under renovation/ Mainteance and unable to use.

My question to you is WHY open the app for us to book and now telling us it’s NOT usable in the LAST MOMENT???? Do you know that we are unable to book any more courts for this 2 dates at your last minute information.

This is not my first encounter of such stupid mistaken, can your organisation please look into this matter seriously, I would expect some higher level personnel to contact me and provide explanation of such irresponsible and ineffective management.

Dear Ms Lee,

I see, is there anyway to delay the start of my new gym pass till the expiry of my old one? If not I would be paying double for March for both gym passes. There was no warning that the gym pass would start at point of purchase before my old one expires. I believe this is not clear to users to your application and partly the fault of your organisation. It should be made clear that if the passes are of different privileges, it would start before the expiry of the current pass the user had already purchased. Thank you.

Dear Mr Teo,

Thank you for writing to Sport Singapore(SportSG).

I understand that you are enquiring on your gym passes.

Please note that the reason why the new pass

did not start after your first pass expired is because they belong to 2 different schemes, peak and non-peak.

Your first pass MyActiveGYM™ Adult Off-Peak (6 Months) is expiring on 31 Mar 2021 and the new pass MyActiveGYM™ Adult Peak (6 Months) will expire on 25 Aug 2021.

Thank you and Stay Safe.

Importance: High

 

Dear: Chief Executive Director / Managing Director of ActiveSg,

 

I hope that this email finds you in the pick of health, and that you had a
great start of 2021.

Please allow me to introduce myself, I am Jiun Keong (JK) from Purlife
Company Pte Ltd. We are an Indoor Air Quality Specialist with established
credentials and experience in professional solutions, investigation, and
evaluation of Indoor Air Quality through affordable indoor air purifier and
cleaning services for clean air living at affordable cost and currently
provide 80% of the childcare centres in Singapore with improved air quality
services.

 As the COVID-19 epidemic repeated all over the world, air quality has been
the concerns of most of our clients that has high traffic within their
premises especially reception. Through the use of air purifiers, outbreaks
such as HFMD, Viral Fever/Flu has been greatly reduced. I believe we share
the same objectives of improving germs free and good air quality to protect
your staffs and clients from harmful bacteria/viruses and dangerous fine
particles within our premises with all the current safety measures being put
in place for social distancing, wearing masks, handwashing, and
disinfecting, we strongly believe indoor air quality is an important measure
that should not be taken lightly too. 

 It is our aim to create a safe and clean indoor environment through the
fundamentals of purified air. Our corporate clients consist mainly childcare
groups like Busy Bee Group, Kinderland, Skool4Kidz, Little Footprints,
Kiddiwinkie, Agape, Iman Childcare, Agoda Company, DVB Bank, Pantec
Engineering etc.

It has been challenging for business during this Covid-19 pandemic. We
believe every business's owners  priority is to keep their staff safe and
customer safe, working in a positive environment and I would like to
schedule a meet up / phone call session with you to formally introduce
myself and discuss a possible opportunity to bring quality indoor air to
your company which greatly benefits your clients too.

I can be reached anytime and look forward talking to you. Keep Safe

I have been thinking about your reply since last Sunday and I’m shocked that such discrimination exists in a beautiful, multicultural country. I’m very disappointed with Active SG. 

We will continue to try and book a court as that is the only way we can play tennis. But this has made us feel unwelcome in the country that we live and love. 

Sincerely,
Brooke Holland

Hi Yuan Ting,

“We kindly advise members to make bookings on different devices and
timeslots.”

For ios, This is happening regardless of what time. Even just browsing
activesg apps. Limit is 7 clicks it will hang for 1 minute. It started last
Tuesday afternoon if I remembered it correctly.

We need to close and reopen the apps when it hang.

Please check. Thanks.

Hi,

Can we suggest that you try to clear the app cache and try again?
Alternatively, you can try to uninstall and reinstall the app.

In addition, kindly be informed that due to high traffic during peak
booking hours (7am, 12pm or 8pm), the app and website may take slightly
longer to load. The speed at which your booking page loads would also
depend on your device's internet connection speed and connection strength.

Thank you.

"﻿Dear Active SG Team,

I am the Daddy of Lucius Li Auris who has joined the soccer class at Sat mornings at Bukit Gombat stadium and he likes it very much - here are much questions :
1/ could not find in your app how to sign him up for the next classes after the holiday - saw only the holiday program - Can you help me to sign him up for the same class he is on as before ?
2/ how can I use the credit of 100SGD ?
3/ the app’s mentioned that I need to bring his birth certificate to verify his account - where can I do that ? Since now there are no more classes ? Can you pls advise whether I can do that at one of the community center like Cairnhill ? 
4/ after verifying his account does he also receive the 100 SGD welcome bonus ?
Pls kindly help to reserve a slot for him for his loved soccer class same as before

verified. And she suggested me to send email to ActiveSG.
Attached is the photos.
Please advise and thank you.

"Please change the way facilities booking is processed.Currently, the way slots are assigned is ineffective. When you select a timing, it is tied to a fixed slot. If someone books that slot before you, when you select Add to cart, you will be told, one of the slots you have selected is not available, even though there are other slots left. Then you have to back out, re-enter, and try again. This repeats as long as more than one user selects the same slot as determined and allowed by the system.Today I had to do this at least 3 times because many users are trying to book beginning 12 noon.Instead of assigning the slot at the moment of time selection, the system should assign the next available slot upon Add to cart. The system should also not assign the same slot to more than one user. I hope that makes sense.Darrell Tan ",Web

Subject: [CASE:214546] Can't create supplementary account in ActiveSG for
my daughter
To: Carissa Lim 


Hi,

Thank you for quick reply.

Is it possible to tag her account to my account instead of my
wife's account so it will be easier for me to book a program for her and
her younger sister (her younger sister's account is tagged to my account)
since my wife never login to her account.

Can I book holiday program for children if her account is not verified yet?

Thanks,
Rubby

Hi

Thank you for writing to the ActiveSG technical helpdesk.

We have checked in our system that your daughter has an existing account.
Kindly check if her account is tagged under your spouse's account, and
proceed to the nearest sports centre or swimming complex to verify your
child's account as it has not been verified yet. Please bring along her
original birth certificate.

Hope this helps!

With Best Regards,

"Dear Sir/Mdm

I had an issue in booking badminton court for last 4-5 months,
1) After circuit breaker, i understand only sports hall where open, School
halls are not open. so it was justified get booking on 7am had a issue due
to less availability.
2) But when school hall starts to open on Dec holidays i expected it would
be back to normal like before circuit breaker.But it did not happen to my
wonder.

3) The main issue is when at 7am we sign in to book and when we choose the
sports hall the apps where is was stuck there by showing
rolling(processing). After 2 minutes only it was allow us to go into the
schedule where it was almost full. How others can go in and book ??.Why we
are blocked/kept hold like this?? i tried through the website also the
result is same.

4) Before Covid we can enter is not available we can look for other
facility to book

I write through FB chat to Clementi Sportd hall  couple of months before
until today no answer

Hi

There is still no zoom link sent for today’s , nor in my junk box. Same as last week. I have tried calling the number given at the TP Cc as well as 2 other numbers given :
62567151
62567152
But there is either no answer and it just keeps ringing  or it goes straight to a voice message.

Seems pointless to provide Tel for public if staff are not handling them.

"Dear sir
I expect this answer with no value.

Your booking is open at 7am means i can enter only at 7am.that is not the
issue.

Before CB,  we can enter to the slot chedule without any problem there i
understand geting space is depend on people""s reaction at the time of huge
traffic for booking and few times we was told that slot selected was
already selected.

But nowadays we even cant enter into the slot schedule. Always freeze or
stick between the facility choosen and slot schedule chart.

Thanks

my father has managed to book a slot tomorrow tuesday morning at katong

Hi

There is still no zoom link sent for today’s , nor in my junk box. Same as last week. I have tried calling the number given at the TP Cc as well as 2 other numbers given :
62567151
62567152
But there is either no answer and it just keeps ringing  or it goes straight to a voice message.

Seems pointless to provide Tel for public if staff are not handling them.

  Re: [CASE:214685] ActiveSG Contact UsHi Carolyn,
Can we check if you have previously verify your child account over the counter?
If you have verified your child account previously, there will be high chances that the officer on ground have set the ewallet pin for your child but have forgotten to inform you the ewallet pin number for your child account.
You may try the default pin for your child account which is 123456, 111111 or 000000. If all the number listed is incorrect, then you have to go down to the counter to reset the pin as your child account does not have any email address registered under his account.
Hope this clarifies.

I can't reset online and it is ridiculous to ask me to go to the center to reset it when I never even set it before.

"Hi Yuan Ting,

We spoke a few mins ago.

On 24th Dec 2020, I thought I was given the option to convert the ActiveSG
$ to 365 Healthpoints. However after the conversation was done, I realised
my 365 Healthpoints were converted into ActiveSG $ instead.
This is not my intention. Could the technical team please assist to revert
this transaction?
You may refer to the attachment for reference.

Thank you.

Regards,
Gwen

" Hi Azimah,
I went to Clementi sports hub last Saturday. The Active SG staff checked with her pad and confirmed that my account has been verified. And she also wondered why my $100 is not in my e-wallet, so she suggested me to send email to ActiveSG.Anyway I have tried to login via web browser, it is the same. Attached is the screen shot.Please advise.

 Re: [CASE:214575] Fwd: [CASE:214557] Please adviseHi Ningsih,

Can you try to log in your ActiveSG via the web browser and try to verify your account from there?
Link to login via web browser : https://members.myactivesg.com/
Once you are log in, on the main page click on the ""X"" icon which is located beside your name, it will direct you to the Singpass login page. Then log in using your Singpass NRIC and password..
Also ensure that you have set your e-wallet pin after you have verified your account again.
Do revert if issue still persist.


Thank you.

Azimah

I believe you did not get my question correctly.

I am trying to find out...
if I did not go down to the Swimming Complex for the child's verification,
will it affect his Swim Safer test on 18 March?

Can I say that child's verification is only needed if I would like to have
the $100 credit?
I am not asking the usage of the $100 credit. I am more concern if my child
still able to take the Swim Safer test and will he be able to get the
hardcopy cert if I did not go down to the Swimming Complex for his account
verification.

I've been unable to submit online feedback via the Sport Singapore Online
Feedback System,thus I'm sending you this email instead.

I would like to request for the re-instatement of the $100 active sg fund
which I did not have the chance to use at all.

The active sg app was downloaded in my handphone when I was at the
community club some years ago and when I lost my handphone, I forgotten all
about this app and was busy looking for a job.

I have an elderly 85-year-old mother, whom I would need to accompany to the
active sg gym for her regular workout so that she could remain mobile for
as long as possible.

As I'm not working now, I hope that you could kindly re-instate the $100 to
my active sg account so that I could bring my elderly mom for her regular
workout at the active sg gym.

This is regarding the booking of gym slot for Tampines gym. I have been trying to book gym slot for Tampines gym w/o success. Am not sure why but within 9min all the 7am slots are gone. And now since the booking has been change to 12pm I thought it'll be better but on Monday I tried to book Thursday 7am gym slot but within 6min all gone. What is worst is you are trying so hard to get slot and system keep asking you to verify that you are not a robot. And this doesn't happen just once. By the time you finish verifying all the slots are gone. By the way this is the 2nd time I sincerely write in to let you know the problem I encountered. Please kindly get back as I did not receive any reply the previous time. Thank you.

"Hi,

I realise there is some system bug during Badminton Court Booking from
ActivSg apps.

Firstly, the system tends to hang/load for few minutes whenever i check for
any dates. It usually happens the moment i click for 5th or 6th times. This
happens often even though i avoided those peak timing (7am) to book/rush
with other people. May i know whats the issue with this?

Secondly, I realised there are few Sports Hall have some prebooked slot on
weekdays peak hour around 7pm to 10pm. No matter how fast or early i get
inside to book, i dont see those timing. Is there anyways for user to
prebook or book in advance?

Appreciate your response.
Thank you so much. 🙂

It has been many times that we are unable to book the Badminton slot for weekday evening. 

What’s the reason why all the weekday evening slots are missing at 7:01am? 

It’s impossible that the time slots are gone so fast for whole Singapore sports hall. 

Kindly get the respective department to revert back. Much appreciated.

"Dear Zachary,

Thank you for your prompt reply.

I have totally forgotten about the need to have the account verified. I will do it when I bring her for her swimming lesson this Saturday.

Thank you.

Dear Ms Png,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.

We have checked in the system and noted that the account is still an unverified account.

Account verification is necessary to claim the ActiveSG $100 credits, to be eligible for local rates, and to be able to book facilities 15 days in advance.

Unverified accounts may still proceed with booking of facilities and programmes but capped at standard rates.

Hence, this would be why $1.70 was charged instead of $0.60.

To verify the account, please proceed to any ActiveSG sports center or swimming pool. Please bring along the original birth certificate.

For technical-related issues, contact us again at +65 65941388 (Mon to Sun, 7am to 10pm) or email: helpme@iappsasia.com.
For other enquiries, click here. https://members.myactivesg.com/feedback.

Thank you.

With Best Regards,
Zachary

Dear Sir/Mdm,

I am writing in as there is an error in the deduction of fees for my child Ong Jia Hui Keryssa (T1503287H). Her entry fee is supposed to be $0.60 but I was being charged at $1.70 on 3 ocassions (Receipts attached: 20 Feb 2021, 27 Feb 2021 & 06 Mar 2021). Please help to look into this and reimburse the previous 3 charges.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Kathryn

"Hello 
I am having issues in registering my daughter for the next round of her Hockey classes that she currently attends.
The app shows an error that says only registered members can apply, but she is registered and is currently attending the program! The App team were unable to help on the call.
There is some urgency so that she does not miss out on her place
Her fin number is G3916297R and her name is Amelie Long. 
We would like her to attend the U12 Hockey program at ActiveSG Boon Lay here:

"Dear ActiveSG Staff,
Can I suggest for the Gym Booking to open half of the gym slot at 7am (same as before) then other half on 12pm..
Reason is that mostly who is working at Manufacturing like myself cannot access mobile during working time..So can only book early morning before going to work and at night. But at night the slot is already fully occupied..
Hope for your kind consideration..

Thank you for your reply.

I also assumed your comment ""If you already have the mobile number in your

with the same mobile number in your account."". However, this is not the
answer I am looking for. We have only 2 mobile numbers (Leo's father and
mother) and Leo doesn't have his mobile. In this case, how can we set up
the contact? It seems that communications from the owner of the program are
being sent to an old number that is not being used, but we have no way to
check it and are having trouble.

"Hi There,
Your website conveniently doesn’t not allow you to put any details in for complaints and just has a bot to guide you in the wrong direction.
I want a response to this email as I have a complaint against your runners and coach at Macrichie reservoir on Saturday mornings. I have been running there for years and put up with arrogant, rude and inconsiderate runners on a weekly basis. I approached the coach Steven Quek last week and explained that this is NOT a running track it’s a PUBLIC place and his runners have zero respect. He looked at me as if, how dare I have a complaint about any of his runners, didn’t have any manners himself,as he walked away did not even hear me out or, apologise or take it respectfully from a member of the public!! 
There are elderly people and young children walking/hiking etc...members of the public, (may I repeat this is a PUBLIC place), have the right to feel safe and comfortable without being shoved, knocked over by runners who think they own the trails.
Steven should have listened to what I had to say, taken it in and spoken to his students. It’s a simple case of manners that’s it! Not difficult. But to walk away when a complaint is made by a member of the public is NOT acceptable as a running coach. A. It’s rude and pathetic, B. Clearly shows why his students have no manners because they learn from him.
I used to teach in Singapore if I though my students were not respecting other people’s space or not being ethical,(especially in sport), I would not be happy. As I said already it comes down basic manners. “Excuse me” “sorry I knocked into you” It’s really not that hard but the coach should have taken all of those complaints onboard because that’s what coaches, teachers and Trainers do, simple fact.
I had one girl who clapped her hands because she wanted people to move people to move out of HER way last week. Excuse me but WHO are you??? Again NOT a running track! I was horrified and told her we are people not monkeys and you certainly don’t clap at people to move for you in a public place....would you do that on the MRT????No exactly.
Their whole attitude is disgraceful and I want a response to this or I will escalate it to all superiors and Singapore sport United. Everyone loves Macrichie but the runners are ruining it and making it dangerous for all who enjoy it.
All it takes it to be taught simple manners it’s not a lot to ask and I’ll will keep on telling them to move out of the way for others when I’m running until they learn what manners is.
First and foremost their coach also needs to learn manners and past that on to their students.
There is a lot of learning to be done here and I want to know what you as a group are going to do about it.
Regards Emma.

Hi Ningsih,

Can you try to log in your ActiveSG via the web browser and try to verify
your account from there?

Link to login via web browser : https://members.myactivesg.com/

Once you are log in, on the main page click on the ""X"" icon which is
located beside your name, it will direct you to the Singpass login page.
Then log in using your Singpass NRIC and password..

Also ensure that you have set your e-wallet pin after you have verified
your account again.

Do revert if issue still persist.

Hi Ms Rashidah,

We have checked and have noted that the user is a Permanent Resident. Hence, she would not have free gym/pool entry, as it is only for all Singaporeans above 65 years of age.

Hi Iapps,





As per tele-conversation with Huijing, SDA from Bukit Gombak,





A Guest came and feedback free entry to gyms is not available on her app/web, she would be charged $1.50 for gym when she tries to book. She does not want to pay for gym as a senior citizen with ActiveSG$.   She would be 74 yrs old this year.





Guest would want this issue to be rectified the soonest.

Dear SM Jeremy and D Janice,
Thank you for your reply and clarification. Would there be a viable alternative in the coming future?

As doing a refund order would take a longer procedure and guests then would not be able to book the subsequent 8.45pm slot if they so wishes.

If, we allow these affected guests via scan in for the 8.45pm slot, we may not want to start a precedent and guest would
not want to book slots in the future since walk-in are available. Please advise.

Thank you. Stay Active and Stay Safe.

Dear Jeremy and Rodgie,


Thank you for your replies.





May I know what is the resolve to this issue?


This does not only pertain to Bukit Batok Swimming Complex as I have checked with my other
colleagues at other centre it applies to them too.





Husnul and Wai Seng, don’t mind please assist to escalate, thank you.





We want to close just a single slot 7.30pm to 8.30pm but system shows us 2 slot timings instead:





IF we choose 7pm to 8pm


System will close


6.15pm to 7.15pm AND


7.30pm to 8.30pm





IF we choose 8pm to 9pm


System will close


7.30pm to 8.30pm AND


8.45pm to 9.45pm






Stay Active and Stay Safe.

Dear Zahari,








Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.








As per checking with our backend team, this is currently how the system works as the time slots for bukit batok swimming complex breaks the conventional time slot setting. The conventional timeslot setting is e.g. 7-8, 8-9.

Dear Zahari,





In admin panel, the closure timing that you can select is e.g. 5-6pm, 6-7pm, 7-8pm, 8-9pm, 9-10pm.


The filter is by hour. Thus you can't specifically select 7.30pm - 8.30pm.





On top of that, because currently the swimming complex timeslots are set at e.g. 7.45pm, 8.45pm, 10.00pm.


Thus the closure listing will only show the timeslots available which are in the above stating timing.

"I totally understand that i am only able to book once my child turns 11 on his birthday.

But why isnt is standardized across all centres? Why is there a difference in the target age group for other centres. In particular, Bedok and Hougang allowed me to book for their U12 trainings as their target age group is set for 10-12.

Kind Regards,

Dear Sir/Mdm,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.


We have checked in the system and found that your child's birthdate has not passed yet and is still currently 10 years old thus, you won't be able to register for the U12 Football at Tampines.


The system will detect the age by Date of Birth and not Birth Year.


If you would like to register for the programme before your child's birthday, you may need to contact the respective Sports Centre in charge of the programme to check with them.

"Hi! 

I went to Bedok Heartbeat on Wednesday evening to put 10 plastic bottles into the reverse vending machines and keyed in details to an ActiveSG account for the $0.50 reward.

If I recall correct, the RVM stated that the $0.50 would be cashed into the account the next day. 

However, to date I’ve not received any $0.50 to the account I entered within the RVM.  

Can you please advise. Let me know if you need any info/details from me?

Dear Ms Koh,



I am Isadora, a teacher from Canossa Catholic Primary School. I spoke to you earlier over the phone regarding some technical issues faced when I tried to access the CorpPass platform to opt-in to the SEP grant. I have applied for a CorpPass account but the process will take about 3 working days to be completed, however, I am aware that the deadline given is the 28th of February. Hence I am writing this email to express our school's interest to opt-in to the SEP grant.



Thank you for your time and I am so sorry for the inconvenience caused.

1. I made registration with Active SG under my Dependent Pass number by using my phone no. and email address.

"Dear Shafinaz

I wish to express my unhappiness with the assistance that has been rendered by the helpdesk.

I had emailed the helpdesk on Tuesday that I did not receive any link to make payment after giving parental consent.

I was next asked to provide my child’s particulars. Thereafter, the problem was not resolved, and no updates was provided. I had to email everyday for updates. I also informed the helpdesk that it is urgent because there was a 72hours reserve time frame that I was given between registration and payment.

Today, after 4 days from my first email, I have been informed to contact the Sports Centre to add my child in instead. The program is already fully subscribed and I do not know if my child would be able to register after all now.

Such helpdesk response standards are dissatisfactory and frustrating. Is there someone that I can refer this case to?

Regards
Elizabeth

"Hi Azimah,

Thanks for the clarification. But I can’t seem to book any gym slots after purchasing the monthly gym pass. 

The slots are always taken up. In that case, does it warrant any refund or am I able to access the gym without booking the time slots in advance? 

Thanks,
Charlie

"Dear ActiveSg Football,

I mistakenly signed up my older son, Connor Chow, for ActiveSG Football Academy Season 2 when I was signing up for my younger son, Caden Chow. In fact, Connor should not be registered and I didn't realize that the ActiveSG website was logged in to his account when I registered.

I would like to request that Connor Chow be cancelled for the upcoming season that is to start on March 27, 2021 and if you could refund my credit card? Hopefully this is early enough warning for you to be able to reverse the transaction, but please let me know if there are any issues.

"Hi Sir/Madam,

I have used my wife's activesg account to book for a badminton court at
queenstown primary school on 14 march 2021 from 6pm to 7pm.

Due to my wife looking after a baby, she unable to play together with us,
so I brought my son to play.

To my disbelief, the security say the person who book the court need to be
around. Does this regulation sound fair? Especially to those parents that
have small children and at the same time need to bring the older kid for
some form of exercise?

What if I'm the one booking the court but I needed to be at home and so my
wife cannot bring my son to play? As I am the one who book.

Please review this regulation although I understand it is use to prevent
others for booking for other people..

And what kind of regulation is this that we cannot cancel the booking? Or
even ask for refund? I going to see my MP to find out more about all this
regulation that are just implement.

Hi Annabelle,



Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.



You will need to ask your brother to sign up for Singpass for account
verification in order to claim the ActiveSG $100 credits.



May I know if your brother is currently a supplementary member?



Kindly provide us with your brother's NRIC number to check.

Dear Sir/Mdm





We were trying to sign up an account for my 16 year old brother, tagged to
my father’s account but was unable to do so. In addition, he doesn’t has a
Singpass account.





According to your FAQ site, only members under 15 years can visit the
sports centres for verification. So how should we go about signing up
account for my brother?





Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

"Hi there

Just wanted to say thanks to one of your staff -
I appreciated the help from Carissa to try to update my daughter’s stage 3 exam record. I received the certificate since Dec 2020 but her certificate record is not updated in the Active SG system and the coach is not able to provide me with the assessment code despite I asked the coach a number of times!

Carissa called me back within an hour the day I called, that is 15 March to follow up.

I hope that Carissa will be able to help me retrieving the assessment code and update the record accordingly.

Many thanks

Subject: [CASE:206210] ActiveSG Swim saver program

Hi there

Ophelia Chan Aggarwal my daughter has completed stage 3 swim safer program and received the certificate in December 2020.

<7b93c3c0-5ee9-11eb-93cc-0673f5a54cf2.jpeg>


However the system of Active SG does not show it. Can you please update it so that it’s shown in the system.

Thanks a lot
Pauline

"To whomever it may concern:

This is to inform that my son, Joseph Elijah Woo Yi Xiang will be unable to attend the Flying Disc program on 16th March. I attach his receipt for reference. You can make his slot available to others if needed.

Thank you.

but when I login there is no any amount of money in my account.
Could you help to check this for me?
Thank you bery much.

"Hi, 

The purpose of writing this email is to share the experience of using ActiveSG app for the past months. 

Usually on every Saturdays, I’ll be standing by to book badminton courts. Over the past months, I have been experiencing difficulties like continuous/ lacking of page. That’s prevent me from making booking all these while.

I understand that general public is also experiencing the same issue and was wondering whether can anything be done to better facilitate the booking of courts? Thanks. 

Brandon Feng",Booking
"Hi again,

I’m very frustrated and furious. This email reply seems like an auto
generated email. The app is still as lousy as ever. I lost a few gym days
thanks to the god awful booking system. I bought membership and I intend to
maximise the use out of it. But it a daily hassle to get the first slot to
book the gym through this lousy app you all have created. Not to mention
the replies are ambiguous. Not the slightest hint of intention to fix this
LOUSY BOOKING System. I really don’t know what kind of app developer y’all
have hired for this But it seems like you guys are not taking ANY
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS GARBAGE YOU HAVE CREATED.

Hi,



Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.



Please update the ActiveSG Android mobile app from the Google Play Store to the latest Version. Upon accessing the Step Challenge, if prompted to allow ActiveSG access to Google Fit data, please tap “OK” and choose your Google account.



The chosen Google account must match that in use in Google Fit. Within Google Fit Settings, under “Google Fit Data”, “Activity detection” and “High accuracy mode” must be switched on, and ActiveSG must be listed inside “Apps connected”.



Optional, but please also try this step if the above does not work:

Settings -> Apps (or Installed Apps) -> ActiveSG -> Clear Cache & Clear Data

Uninstall and reinstall ActiveSG





If there is a significant discrepancy with your step count, please submit a screenshot of your daily step count from the Health app, starting from the day you joined Step Challenge, along with a screenshot of your data sources (Health Data -> Activity -> Steps -> Data Sources & Access).







For technical-related issues, contact us again at +65 65941388 (Mon to Sun, 7am to 10pm) or email: helpme@iappsasia.com. For other enquiries, click here. https://members.myactivesg.com/feedback.

2) when trying to book a session, long wait times, till time out after clicking on the gym and the date—Friday Mar 19.  I.e., no time slots are displayed.

3) after closing and restarting app few times, able to get to gym time slots.  right before my finger touched the screen, all time slots disappeared.  no error message displayed.

Subject: Badminton Facilities AND Booking Solution To Better Utilize the Resources (For MOE Reference No: ""2021/02/009173"")

Dear All,

I believe you have seen and read the recently news on Badminton Court Booking issues and challenges in getting court booked for our own game with our own friends.  For me, the booking challenges are NOT new issues (although selling the court is really news to me and also shocking to know, how some have managed to sell the courts!!!!!).  I thought through, as I one of the regular ActiveSG Sports Facility User (Badminton) and Badminton is my PASSION.  Having such a passion to the game, I invested, encouraged my friends to play Badminton, donated racquets etc.,  Also keep trying to reach out ActiveSG / MCCY and other known associations/organizations contacts in resolving the issues and to make the system to work for all equally.  All my requests so far, did not give desired results. So writing a proposal as a last resort to get the situation better.

Please find attached proposal for your perusal and I strongly believe that you will consider the proposal and respond accordingly.  With available time and resources I have, the proposal is prepared, it may not be perfect.  I believe your prestigeous organizations know-how, expertise, resources, my initial proposal can be enhanced/improved. Also the enhanced / improved proposal can be implemented in 3-6 months time easily.  In summary the proposal talks about;


  1.  Challenges of Court Booking and using
  2.  Some of the solutions (Immediate, Short-Term and Long-Term)
  3.  Critical Success Factor and Joint Responsibilities
     *   Setup Facility Management Board comprising MOE, ActiveSG/Sports SG / MCCY, HPB, SBA representative
     *   Release School Indoor Sports Halls (ISHs) to public use on Weekdays too
     *   Enhance the ActiveSG Booking System / Server infrastructure to serve better with same booking open time either 7:00:00AM or 6:00:58AM and equal No. of steps on PC Browser & Mobile App
     *   Setup System to enable Certified Coach as the Facility Manager (instead of ActiveSG managing the facility to open and close the ISHs)
     *   Setup Star-Points / De-Merit Points Program to enhance the existing Coach Certification / Registry
     *   Setup the Data Capturing System Solution and “Badminton and Health” research for the betterment of society

I am willing to discuss further in person, if such need arises.  Feel free to warrant me for the discussion.  Following files are attached as part of the proposal;

  1.  Proposal (""Badminton_Facilities_AND_Booking_Solution_To_BetterUtilizeResources.docx"")

Subject: Badminton Facilities AND Booking Solution To Better Utilize the Resources (For MOE Reference No: ""2021/02/009173"")

Dear All,

I believe you have seen and read the recently news on Badminton Court Booking issues and challenges in getting court booked for our own game with our own friends.  For me, the booking challenges are NOT new issues (although selling the court is really news to me and also shocking to know, how some have managed to sell the courts!!!!!).  I thought through, as I one of the regular ActiveSG Sports Facility User (Badminton) and Badminton is my PASSION.  Having such a passion to the game, I invested, encouraged my friends to play Badminton, donated racquets etc.,  Also keep trying to reach out ActiveSG / MCCY and other known associations/organizations contacts in resolving the issues and to make the system to work for all equally.  All my requests so far, did not give desired results. So writing a proposal as a last resort to get the situation better.

Please find attached proposal for your perusal and I strongly believe that you will consider the proposal and respond accordingly.  With available time and resources I have, the proposal is prepared, it may not be perfect.  I believe your prestigeous organizations know-how, expertise, resources, my initial proposal can be enhanced/improved. Also the enhanced / improved proposal can be implemented in 3-6 months time easily.  In summary the proposal talks about;


  1.  Challenges of Court Booking and using
  2.  Some of the solutions (Immediate, Short-Term and Long-Term)
  3.  Critical Success Factor and Joint Responsibilities
     *   Setup Facility Management Board comprising MOE, ActiveSG/Sports SG / MCCY, HPB, SBA representative
     *   Release School Indoor Sports Halls (ISHs) to public use on Weekdays too
     *   Enhance the ActiveSG Booking System / Server infrastructure to serve better with same booking open time either 7:00:00AM or 6:00:58AM and equal No. of steps on PC Browser & Mobile App
     *   Setup System to enable Certified Coach as the Facility Manager (instead of ActiveSG managing the facility to open and close the ISHs)
     *   Setup Star-Points / De-Merit Points Program to enhance the existing Coach Certification / Registry
     *   Setup the Data Capturing System Solution and “Badminton and Health” research for the betterment of society

I am willing to discuss further in person, if such need arises.  Feel free to warrant me for the discussion.  Following files are attached as part of the proposal;

  1.  Proposal (""Badminton_Facilities_AND_Booking_Solution_To_BetterUtilizeResources.docx"")
  2.  Request submitted at ""Meet the People Session"" (""Meet_the_People_Session_MPS_PunggolNorth_20190902.docx"").  The response for the same can be seen on the Proposal Appendix-B
  3.  Booking Issues and Correspondence for 2019 (I did not add previous years, should you need let me know) (""ActiveSG_CourtBooking_Issues_Emails_for_2019.pdf"")
  4.  Booking Issues and Correspondence for 2020 (""ActiveSG_CourtBooking_Issues_Emails_for_2020.pdf"", ""ActiveSG_CourtBooking_Issues_Emails_for_2020_01.pdf"", ""ActiveSG_CourtBooking_Issues_Emails_for_2020_02.pdf"" and ""ActiveSG_CourtBooking_Issues_Emails_for_2020_03.pdf"")

Hi,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.

Can I check if the reason for your withdrawal from the programme is because
the Sports Centre notified you that the programme is postponed?

If so, you will need to contact the Sports Centre directly to enquire about
the refund.

Hope this clarifies!

"Dear Sir/Mdm,

I am writing in to provide feedback regarding my experience of using the App.

I am using Android phone but for the past few months, I have experienced very slow loading / speed of using the app to book facilities.
I work with my friends to book the facilities for our regular sessions at the sports hall.

It seems like all my friends using Android phones have the same slow speed issue whereas my friends using Apple phones do not face the issue.
So it's always my friends who uses Apple phone that is able to get the bookings done.

A lot of times, my phone will be still loading when my friend has already completed the booking and payment.

Please kindly advise.

It must have months during the lockdown that the equipment have not been
used. Therefore there were signs of rust on the metal particularly on the
bench presses and bars. It is such a waste to see such machine dilapidate
when it just need needs to be wiped down.

The activesg app is running really really slow. Can you do something about

"Hi,

I've accidentally pre-booked the wrong date for the Pasir Ris ActiveSG Gym.

I had initially thought that I booked a 3:00 pm timeslot for today, 17 March. But I couldn't find my booking when I entered the app.

I then realized that I had been automatically charged $2.50 for a booking on the 16 March.

The problem is, I remember the app mentioned that I have to make payment in order to secure my booking, which I did not do on my own.

Because I thought my booking was today, 17 March, instead of yesterday, 16 March. I'm not able to use the gym on either dates.

Could you refund me the $2.50 and guide me on how to turn off automatic payment?

Warm Regards,
Yanan

Hi Helpdesk,

We require your urgent attention on this matter as the instructor is to have the assessment on the 28th of March.
He is unable to make a booking on his end as the system does not reflect his name. However when the team and I performed a check on MMS, his name is reflected accordingly. We hope that you can help resolve this matter for us as soon as possible.

"Hi Yuan Ting
I have called up Bukit Batok but they asked me to contact help desk. 
Would appreciate if you can direct me to the correct channel. There must be an improvement made to the Active SG app as it is not giving the correct information. 
I think this is a technical issue. Is there someone I can speak to with regards to this?

Hi,

I have signed up for the Piloboxing course at Yio Chu Kang Dance Studio which started on 3 Mar and 3 sessions have been conducted so far.

However, due to personal reasons I have yet to attend even one. My son was sick (I can produce his MC) and the first 2 sessions and I was unwell yesterday after taking the covid vaccine. And I am due for the 2nd dose in 3 weeks time which also falls on a Wed.

I was wondering if its possible for ActiveSG to let me join the next run instead? 

My contact no. is 91599525. Thank you.

"Hi,

ActiveSG app keep closing the moment i try to make payment. As a result,
I'm not able to buy passes. Pls fix the issue.

As i have 2 dependents under my account, it is too much of hassle to top up
for each account and keep switching just to buy passes. Furthermore, there
is no option to transfer the credit.

I hope the app can further improve by allowing the main account holder to
buy on behalf of their dependents, and have some flexibilty to either
refund the credit, or transfer to another account.

Above are my humble feedback on the app. Pls contact me at 98284465 if you

Dear Azimah

The app issue wasn't rectified at all, looked at how long the loading icon
is circling as per attached files, more than 1 min and I have to exit and
re-enter the app but by then, 2 mins have gone by before finally able to
see the slots appearing again.

It makes a booking impossible, my friend using iphone has no issue while I
am using a Samsung S10+ device but always facing same issue. We have
already been going through this issue more than 2 months.

I would like to hear a good explanation from your end.

Truly disappointed at the tech team of Activesg.

"Hi,

I have registered ActiveSG membership for my daughter using this email address and a phone number. When I tried to register using the same number for my husband it failed. Does it mean one phone number can only be used for one account? I am also not able to remove phone number from my daughter’s account. How do people usually register for kids if they don’t have a separate phone number? How can I register a new account for my husband now?

Also, I was trying to change the account details to my husband’s info but it was not working since it’s already linked to my daughter’s IC (I think). But when I tried to change the email address back from 13501061965.139.com (new one I entered, not verified yet) to this email address (original one used during registration) it failed again, showing “this email address already existed”. How can I change it back? Do I need to verify the new one and then change it back?

"Hi Sir/Mdm,
I've being booking badminton court online for many years and is not easy to book for the past few years as the system kept hanging. But after SG Active came up with the CAPTCHA (I'm not a robot and Puzzle Solving) at least I was given a chance to make a booking. Unfortunately, the Puzzle Solving has taken out and booking was once again with difficulty.For the past 4 consecutive weeks (Feb - Mar), I was not even given the chance to compete with others to make the booking, cos my system kept hanging @7am sharp (Fri)even though I'm not using wireless system to make booking. It hang about 3 - 5 mins (I'm not a robot) before it get through the booking page. By the time, all the slots were already taken up. I really appreciate that you can look into this matter and can consider to install the CAPTCHA for Puzzle Solving again, at least I still have a chance to make the booking. We are a group of senior folks badminton lover and have been playing for more than a decade. Now, without this exercise, we feel so loss and despondent.Your understanding and sympathy are highly appreciated.

"Dear Sir,
I am refering to activesg apps on the renewal of monthly swim pass

Date of commencement always starts on the day of the purchase.
The current booking policy is 3 days in advance (usually done for favorite time slot in advance)

Monthly swim pass bought on 22nd ends on the 21st of the next month, a booking on 19th for 22nd swim would not be possible as it expired on 21st.
If the monthly swim pass renewal is made on 19th,  the expiry is on 18th and not 21st of the following month.(The renewable must be done on 19th in order to secure a advance slot on 22nd.Meaning 2 days will be fortified)
Would the apps logic knows that the renewal is done before the current swim pass expired and would extend the new renewal date by continuing the  expiry date to 21st and not taking the date of renewal as the swim pass starts date.
The above is affecting those who renew their passes before it expiry.
Thank you for your attention.

I would like to clarify if there is an expiry of the $100 ActiveSG credits. Apparently I have been awarded the credits on 27 June 2014 but I have never used any of it. Only in 2018, I did a top up using my credit card.

I sincerely appreciate it if you can help me investigate and clarify this matter, as it is very unfair that I do not get to book facilities using these credits.

Subject: Swimsafer Test Assessor
To: 
Cc: 


Good evening Swimsafer department,

I have questions to raise as my assessor Mr Goh Hock Lye did not turn up
for my swimsafer test on 14-03-21 sunday 4pm Stage 2 (BIVMB4H2) and 5pm
Stage 2 (U9YQOT0T) at Jalan Besar SC. So I have no choice but to ask Mr
Peter Chai Woei Guo who was my 3pm stage 2 (PEJIPODY) assessor to stay
behind and replace Mr Goh Hock Lye and oversee my student's test. I tried
calling Mr Goh Hock Lye and was told he already emailed swimsafer about the
changes of assessor but when i login it's still under his name. So I would
like you to change it to Mr Peter Chai Woei Guo to be fair to him that he
stayed behind and test my students.

The 2nd question Mr Goh Hock Lye is also my appointed assessor for 21-03-21
at Jalan Besar SC 3pm stage 3 (DPWJIFGM). I have asked him whether he will
be able to make it for the test and he said he has emailed to swimsafer to
change the assessor too. Can i request Mr Peter Chai Woei Guo to be my
student's assessor as he is also appointed for my 21-03-21 at Jalan Besar
SC 4pm Stage 4 (I8KYUJ7L). Please advise as soon as possible so that my
14-03-21 student's certificate is able to be generated and this saturday is
my student's stage 3 and 4 test.

Best regards,
Donovan Ong Choon Kiat

Another concern is solving captcha. Is it possible to make clear picture of Captcha or make simple question with bigger picture ?
One mistakes  to answer the captcha means waste time and chances to get court is less.

Is it possible to change time for booking ( e.g at midnight ) ?
The concern is at 7 am most of people are busy go to office.

Very disappointed just now from 12pm started. Your system keep on not
allowing me to make gym session for 9am Senja Cashew gym. Click n click
till the slots disappeared, same for 11am, only when I closed out then go
in again, then only then could get the 11am slot, OMG! Not fair, system
issue in queue or what?
From my number you can verify from your system how many times I tried going
in, sigh!

I have been trying to add my child profile to my ActiveSg account as we are

unsuccessful. The system always prompted that my child ID is invalid. I

Another question I had is, can I book a swimming pool entry for my husband

I appreciate your advice on above queries.

Good morning to you.
Regarding on the subject above, I would like to have your attention to my difficulty in registering MyActiveSG.
Previously, I have registered myself with MyActiveSG using my Employment Pass with my phone number(+6593820317).
Very sad to say when I ought to change my personal details through MyActiveSG web & apps, I received unknown error message after logging into Singapss to retrieve MyInfo.
The main reason is because I am currently using this email address which is different with the one registered earlier and also my NRIC.
Due to that, I would like MyActiveSG to help me delete the said account to allow me to register again using my NRIC.
I tried to re-register but to no available due to similar phone number is registered under my old account.
Note: I have not retrieved the S$100 entitled for the old account.

My old details is as follows(registered on current account);

Name: Ting Jack Wee
Old account's email address: willy_wee@hotmail.com
ID: G3338225T
Phone number: 9382 0317

Dear Sir/Mdm,

I am writing in to provide feedback regarding my experience of using the App.

I am using Android phone but for the past few months, I have experienced very slow loading / speed of using the app to book facilities.
I work with my friends to book the facilities for our regular sessions at the sports hall.

It seems like all my friends using Android phones have the same slow speed issue whereas my friends using Apple phones do not face the issue.
So it's always my friends who uses Apple phone that is able to get the bookings done.

A lot of times, my phone will be still loading when my friend has already completed the booking and payment.

Please kindly advise.

Thanks!

I would like to ask your favour to check on something. 

I have signed up for a piloxing class with Elite Star Coach Jeni Lim at Bedok Heartbeat ActiveSG Dance Studio. The first session is today. 

When I signed up, it was stated that the timing is from 7.30pm to 8.30pm. In the receipt as attached, it is also written as such. However, my ActiveSG app is written as 7pm to 8pm.

May I enquire which timing is correct?

May I trouble you to look into this issue? The service provider below has informed us that their clients do not have their SwimSafer E-Cerificates in their account.

However, the service provider we are able to see the e-cert in our Service Provider portal and on our end, the students have been properly marked and should not have an issue with the e-certs.

Could you advise us on how we can resolve this issue? Thank you.

send an email to your address *helpme@iappasia.com  *to
seek a refund as the cancellation is due to an expected and unfortunate
event (sickness of my friend and not able to go out of her bed). Would it
be possible to Option 1: Proceed for refund 13SGD on my wallet or Option 2

As per talk with Kallang Squash Centre, they confirmed refund was possible

"Dear Sirs,

 

Being an active individual, I have been visiting our Active Sg Gym since
many years back.  Due to current COVID pandemic, ActiveSG has implemented
booking policies for all the facilities which is a good control.

  I have signed up for 6months member on the 12 February 2021, where booking
of ActiveSG Gym time slot for 5.00pm  (weekdays) is grouped into the offpeak
period, and therefore no additional charges.

Then came subsequent booking from 22Mar 2021 onwards, I was charged for
booking for 5.00pm slot.  

 

Whatever happen or changes, it is not right and fair for those who have
signed up the membership before any updates, as at time of signing up, the
offpeak period is 5.00pm.

 

Hopefully you could look into this matter.

 

Best Regards

"Just cancel my slots then except for the Tuesdays until 12th April.
The other slots can be better use if other people can book. Also, so that
the trainer is not waiting for me.

What a load of inconvenience.
You want me to understand you but you have to understand my point as well.
Life happens. Circumstances change but I am not required to tell you about
my life in details.

Also, do let your staff know that we cannot cancel. They assured me that
you are able to help me cancel, which you are unwilling to do. If I let my
friend use my slot, that's an infringement of your rules. So I am stuck. I
rather you cancel so others can use. And please dont patronize me and say
next time dont book. When I booked, I was able to commit.

"Hi,

I would like to appeal to reinstate my boy’s active sg $ if possible. I have requested before but it hits covid thereafter and didn’t manage to use and thus expired again. 

He is currently enrolling in taekwondo and swimming at sengkang swimming pool. It would definitely helps in easing some of these sports fee with the Sg $$. 

Appreciate if you could help to review again. 

His particulars as follows:

I logged into the system today at 12.02pm but was logged out repeatedly even after I picked the 7am slot at Toa Payoh gym and the cursur kept going round and round until 12.17pm.  By then all the slots were gone! Sometimes the system is smooth like yesterday by 12.04pm, I got a slot for Thursday 25 March. 

Can't we go back to the previous booking system when we could book for 2 weeks in advance before this 4 day advance booking started?

It was very disappointing today.  Now it depends on luck if I can get in.  Everytime at 12pm it becomes very stressful if I can get a slot or not.

Please make the system work smoothly or let us go back to the previous system.

"Hi Helpdesk,

May I check with you if you know how we can help the following assessor to resolve his issue?

He claims that he is unable to receive the list of assessments every evening to bid on it. However, I can see his name in our MMS system. Any idea why this issue is occurring and how can we resolve it together?

Warm regards,

"Thanks, in fact I did not check before sending email.

I have one more question about the booking, everyday I connect myself at
1pm to book and no more court are available at night ... This is really
strange ! I tried also to connect 5/10 mins before and here the date is not
yet available..
Last time I went to Farrer park and all the court were free whereas on the
application it was not possible to book. How can I arrange booking easily?
How do you explain the non-availability while court are free ?

Thanks a lot for your answer !

"Dear Shafinaz,

It is so nice of you to provide ""secret"" URLs for access to Booking Slots.
Then now you announce that you have
a new rule for booking maximum 3 days in advance. Is it so difficult for
you to simply copy a free word press plug in
to pop up with the same information when some clicks on an object that
prevents usage due to the rule.

Obviously there is nothing wrong with the rule, but the website/app is a
failure for usage.

Its not your fault and you act promptly, But your management has more egg
heads sitting in comfort giving
poor support to users. Thanks and Regards,

Dear MeeLi,



Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.


To update your ActiveSG account from FIN to NRIC, you will need to have your new NRIC Singpass account, and have your personal particulars in MyInfo updated. If you have made any changes, please allow one working day for your personal details to be fully saved in the system first before doing the following steps.

For more information on, or to register for MyInfo, please click here: https://www.singpass.gov.sg/myinfo/intro

Once you have ensured that the above is updated, you may sign in to your existing ActiveSG account (Using Mobile number and password), and update via the
""Retrieve MyInfo"" function.

Website: My Account -> Profile -> Edit My Account -> Retrieve MyInfo
Mobile App: ->ME - > Edit Profile -> Retrieve MyInfo

If you are still unable to update your citizenship online, you will need to head down to the nearest Sports Centre or Swimming Complex and approach the Guest Officer at the counter for assistance.

Hi Helpdesk,





May I trouble you to look into this issue? The service provider below has informed us that their clients do not have their SwimSafer E-Cerificates in their account.





However, the service provider we are able to see the e-cert in our Service Provider portal and on our end, the students have been properly marked and should not have an issue with the e-certs.





Could you advise us on how we can resolve this issue? Thank you.





Warm regards,

Courts are already hard to find as it is and this just makes it so much harder! Especially since you don’t allow someone other than the person who made the booking to show up??
Why?

     I try to buy the swimming pass for my daughter, 4 years old and noted the pass is S$1.70 in the cart. I checked Yishun swimming complex website that indicate the pass is S$0.70 for kid. Hence, I didn’t process for my booking but if you not really these 2 days I would purchase first and hope can get the refund for the differences.

I attached a short video as illustration of booking problems using the
website.
In the video the system is not responsive after entering I am not robot
phase.
It is quite common for the system also not to be responsive after verifying
the capt ha. Some times the latest dates open for booking does not appear.

I hope that the above can be rectified.

Thank you
",Web
"My Internet speed is 900 mbps.
The point is the system is swarmed during the first 5 seconds after 7am
After which 90% of the bookings are done. During this 5 seconds the system
is not reliable. Making booking a frustrating affair.
If the system cannot cope with the overload then maybe Active sg can
staggered the booking time for facilities so that the traffic volume can be
even out.
For example.  Toa Payoh region open at 7am
Ang mo kio open at 730am
Jurong open at 8am and so on

Having a system which cannot cope when 80 to 90 % of booking is done is
like having no system at all

Thank you

Hi Ivy,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.


We have checked in our system and noticed that your child is registered under an Individual ActiveSG Member account. In this case, since your child is under 12 years old, you have to go down to any Sports Centre nearby to request the Guest Officer (GO) at the counter, to convert your child's account to a ""Supplementary Member"" account.

Afterwards, inform the GO there to tag your children under your account. Please bring along your children's original birth certificate.

Hi Ivy,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.


We have checked in our system and noticed that your child is registered under an Individual ActiveSG Member account. In this case, since your child is under 12 years old, you have to go down to any Sports Centre nearby to request the Guest Officer (GO) at the counter, to convert your child's account to a ""Supplementary Member"" account.

Afterwards, inform the GO there to tag your children under your account. Please bring along your children's original birth certificate.

As long as your Corpass account is tagged both to UEN T07GS5003L and NRIC ending with 45G, there should not be any issue.

Dear Ms Koh,







I am Isadora, a teacher from Canossa Catholic Primary School. I spoke to you earlier over the phone regarding some technical issues faced when I tried to access the CorpPass platform to opt-in to the SEP grant. I have applied for a CorpPass account but the process will take about 3 working days to be completed, however, I am aware that the deadline given is the 28th of February. Hence I am writing this email to express our school's interest to opt-in to the SEP grant.







Thank you for your time and I am so sorry for the inconvenience caused.







Regards,



Isadora

Hi team,
  This is taking too long for actions to be taken.

Seek your quick action so as not to delay the students for receiving their certificate

Active sg iapp, Pls amend as swimsafer side has already mentioned they are not able to do it on their end and has advised u to do it.

Thank you

"To whom it may concern,

On 24th March 2021 at around 7.17pm, I made a purchase of a volleyball ($10) and a pump ($5) at a Decathlon outlet located at City Square Mall. My initial payment of $15 using the ActiveSG Mobile App was met with technical difficulty at the cashier of Decathlon, which subsequently indicated that the payment was not successful. As the initial cashier indicated that the payment did not go through, I went to complete my purchase using my UOB One Credit Card at a different cashier.

However, I was appalled to notice that a $15 had been deducted from my ActiveSG wallet when I was making a payment for a booking on the 26th March 2021. I am reaching out to ActiveSG to seek a refund of $15 to my ActiveSG wallet because I believe that ActiveSG proceeded with the transaction despite an error at the cashier of Decathlon. I have attached a copy of my ActiveSG receipt for the unauthorized charge and a screenshot of my UOB credit card charge for my purchase to sustain my claim.

Kindly direct me to the correct authority if you believe that this issue cannot be resolved by ActiveSG,

Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.

I attached a video of today's badminton Court booking.
Booking done through website
My Internet connection is lan based with speed of 900 mbps

As u can see from the video I could not even get a response from the site
at 7am.
For the last two weeks this has become a normal.
Active sg has so far failed to even maintain a working booking system.
It is obvious from my past experience that booking is increasing being
automated from the user end.
If active sg cannot maintain a creditable booking system. The selling of
courts booking will reappear in different form.

The excuse that too heavy a demand is just poor excuse
Active sg could staggered the booking time to level out the overload.

"Dear Team ActiveSG Helpdesk,

I hope this email finds you well.

I called the helpdesk hotline earlier on at around 7.15am to report an
urgent technical issue which resulted in a double charge/deduction of my
funds for the booking of the badminton courts this morning.

Attached in this email are screenshots with the receipt number being
highlighted to help you in resolving this matter such that a refund of
$22.20 could be made after being justified with the proof of transaction
being provided to you.

From the screenshots, you would be able to see that there would be 4
Receipt No being surfaced for the same bookings.

The technical error deduction occured on the web browser for Receipt No:
20210327RN001561 & 20210327RN000252, where payment was collected but the
bookings were still in the shopping cart instead of being reflected under
My Bookings.

*As a result, myself and my dad had to make the second payment via the
ActiveSG App on my phone for Receipt No: 20210327RC004031 &
20210327RC004156 to secure the bookings thus paying twice the amount of
$22.20 via the same DBS POSB Bank Account 228-24702-2 linked to my Debit
Card ending with 8016.*

*Also, it would be great if your team is able to confirm that for the
courts myself and my dad booked for 11 April, there are no other
individuals who also managed to secure the same bookings due to the
technical error. *

*In addition, should the refund be justified, here are the details of my
bank account for the funds to be refunded to: *

POSB Savings: 228 - 24702- 2

Alternatively, PayNow is also possible via 8800 9898.

I look forward to hearing from you soon with regards to the above mentioned
and I thank you in advance for your assistance on this.

Hi Mrs Carpio,

We have checked your son's ID and noted that your son, Brent Jaelord D Carpio already has an existing ActiveSG account which is why the system prompted invalid entry when he tried to sign up for a new account.

Kindly ask him to log into his existing account instead using his NRIC/mobile number and his account password.

He will be able to reset his account password via this link: https://imsva91-ctp.trendmicro.com:443/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fmembers.myactivesg.com%2fauth%2fforgotpassword&umid=8FB10B85-BE7E-BE05-AADF-8B22D2FE0E87&auth=6e3fe59570831a389716849e93b5d483c90c3fe4-0f6c91d8460c016278d73a3516c554d4f44174a0

Hi,

I tried to book again for this Sunday (for 11am at Heartbeat at Bedok gum) when your system opens for booking at noon today (a few minutes ago) but I couldn’t. See in the attached, the same problem. There is certainly some problem with your system which allows only a few to book facilities or they are circumventing some or one of your system to go through to book which your tech team isn’t able to solve.

Thank you.

"Dear Sir
On 26 March 2021 I registered for Active Health programme at Heartbeat@Bedok and was asked to make payment of $10 via MyCash although i had $97 in my ActiveSg. They informed that cash in ActiveSg cannot be used for the payment. In good faith I giro from my POSB account to top up MyCash to make the payment. Payment was made for the programme, but an additional auto top up of $10 was deducted from my bank to MyCash. This automatic additional top up of $10, I did not agree or consent to the auto top up.
Would appreciate the refund of $10 from MyCash. Money is not the issue, in principle deduction of cash regardless of the amount, you need to obtain my consent of which I did not give. I have attached the following documents for your references.

"Hi Helpdesk,

You can close the case 219443.

Findings:
For the member Mr Agustony Sabtian - We checked that he has been able to
collect coins and level up last few days.
So we believe there is no fix required and because the error showed due to
server load so his request was waiting in the queue.

As for the any other future cases, kindly share the user's number or email
id so we can trace the issue for that user.

thank you!

I booked a tennis court at Jurong West on Apr 3rd 11am and I also tried to
book a slot at the Jurong West pool with water slides at 12pm so my kids

However on ActiveSG it seems booking is only possible for the Jurong West

Does this mean that entry to the Jurong West pool with slides is free and
does not require booking a slot on ActiveSG?

Thank you for your prompt response.

As per following your instructions, it is stated ActiveSG $100 has been
credited on 16 May 2014.

However, I have never accessed the ActiveSG app/portal before which means I
did not request for the ActiveSG $100 credit.

Hence, could it be a mistake or was my account hacked previously?

hI,

 

 We have check that your account was registered but not linked to your Singpass account.

 

Although you have log in using Singpass portal, this will not automatically generate your data from your Singpass account therefore your name is display as per your input during account registration.

 

To generate your data from MyInfo and also update your name and DOB correctly, kindly use the web browser and log in to your account first.

 

Once logged in -> click on Edit My Account -> click on ""Retrieve From MyInfo"" and you will then be directed to Singpass log in page. There , log in using your Singpass credential. After you have logged in to your Singpass account, the page will go back to your ActiveSG Edit my Account page. Check and ensure that you profile in your activeSG account is correctly updated and click on submit to save your profile info.

 

Do remember that any changes to your contact information or residential requires you to first update in your Singpass profile and re-trigger the Retrieve from MyInfo function.

 

Hope this help.

 

Thank you.

"Hi,

Thanks for the reply.
I am not really interested in the refund, I just want to release the slot
so that other people may use it. It's a waste that many people are trying
to get a booking, and yet there's a slot that won't be used at all.

If this feature is not yet available, you may consider suggesting adding a
""Cancel"" option (BUT NO REFUND) in your app.  In my case, it was may
mistake so I am in no position to demand for a refund.

I have bought a gym pass that I cannot use anymore. Could you refund it?

Thank you for your help.

Hello,   

My name is Ranjit Somanathan (NRIC - S7885596G).   I was booking badminton courts on 27th March 2021.    Due to issues with the app,  the transaction was getting stuck and the booking wasn't getting confirmed.
Finally i managed to book the court and also enable auto top-up.  However i see multiple deductions from bank account.   The final topup in MyCash is only 30 SGD.   
The Court booking was to deduct SGD. 3.60 from my Bank account while the remaining was to be deducted from MyCash .   Even this amount has been deducted 3 times instead of 1.  
Could you please investigate on what went wrong and refund the excess amount deducted ?  

Attached are the receipts and the snapshot of the transactions.  
ThanksRanjit

"Hi Team,

Can I check on a charge I had, from my banking details, seems that it was
deducted twice for a one month peak pass purchase. However, upon checking,
I only intended to buy one and only did so but my banking reference
reflects a double deduction.

Please refer to screenshots for your reference.

Subject: [CASE:220849] Errorneous Deduction from my Bank account


Hello,   

My name is Ranjit Somanathan (NRIC - S7885596G).   I was booking badminton courts on 27th March 2021.    Due to issues with the app,  the transaction was getting stuck and the booking wasn't getting confirmed.
Finally i managed to book the court and also enable auto top-up.  However i see multiple deductions from bank account.   The final topup in MyCash is only 30 SGD.   
The Court booking was to deduct SGD. 3.60 from my Bank account while the remaining was to be deducted from MyCash .   Even this amount has been deducted 3 times instead of 1.  
Could you please investigate on what went wrong and refund the excess amount deducted ?  

Attached are the receipts and the snapshot of the transactions.  
ThanksRanjit

I’m contacting you regarding my bookings. As i did not know until i was told today that if the booking was made under Person A then Person A have to be there and i have about 6 more bookings after today which i won’t be able to make it as the booking was not under my account which is my mother’s but the timings which i booked she would be busy. I didn’t read the bottom part of the receipt hence my mistake. I was told by the staff at Yio Chu Kang to email this email and get a refund for the courts that i’m unable to attend. So i’m here to discuss with what i should do about the 6 hours of courts i have left!

Subject: Multiple deductions for Badminton court booking

Dear Sir/Madam,

Please refer to the online booking of Badminton court at Westwood Sec school for 11 Apr 2021. Booking were made via Active sg app on 27 Mar 2021 for myself and Eugene Ang Teck Chye.

Active sg Account details:
1. Tan Wee Hock, S7123493B
2. Eugene Ang, S7229016Z

Both accounts were paid using my POSB debit card 003-15912-4.

There were a total of 18 times of deduction each of $14.80 (as per attached) with 3 refund of $14.80.

Both of us only booked two slot each at a total amount of $29.60.

We were using IOS while making the online payment and we faced some difficulties in submission on that day.

For your verification please.

"I will tag him to my account this Friday when I go for my swimming slot at
Senja-Cashew. Had a very unpleasant experience with the booking for my
family this morning at 8.30am. There were 11 slots left for 10am 2 Apr so
me and husband proceeded to book at the same time but when one of us went
through, the other failed. We checked until 10+am for the slot we wanted
for our child but it kept on appearing and disappearing with that same '11
slots left' message. My husband and I had to cancel our 10am slots with no
refunds and get 11am instead just because the system didn't get through for
our son despite showing availability.

I believe a refund should be given since the cancellation is 2 days ahead
and partly due to your inflexible system of single booking at a time. It is
especially hard for families to secure same slots without taking the risk
of losing our money through cancellation. I hope you can look into this
matter for improvement in future.

"Dear Yuki

 

Thank you for your reply. I spoke to the ActiveSg team in Yishun swimming complex who only advised me to write in to your email id and request to reinstate the “welcome S$100/- “ facility granted by the Government to all citizens.

 

They further advised  that I would have received a welcome mail when I registered in 2017 and since I have never used it( because I have not even seen this welcome mail at that time) I will be eligible to get it reinstated as Govt is actively promoting fitness programmes for the elderly.

 

I am 58 years old and have been advised to do pool exercises to help my physical fitness. During this Covid 19 hardship period, it will definitely help me if I can get the Govt grant reinstated.

 

Pls escalate this with your managers and help to reinstate and confirm the same.

 

Pls advise incase I need to take this up with our MP to get any support letter from their office for this purpose.

 

Cheers

Dear Megan



Can you confirm how many ActiveSG account logins that you have? From your email below, I am assuming that you only have one ActiveSG account since you mentioned: I tried to create a new Active SG account the error system pops up as ""invalid entry"".

Please contact ActiveSG how to update your Fin to NRIC in your existing ActiveSG account. Then you should be able to login ActiveSG and SportSync with your new NRIC number, and retrieve your previous Major Game Long list records

Hi Lydia,



Megan Li is unable to log in to SportSync account using her singpass and will require further assistance pls.



She has a complete different login and password after converting from FIN to NRIC number. The system does not allow her to login using her NRIC Singpass nor FIN Singpass.



Can I check if there’s anything we go do to help Megan in this case pls? Fortunately she completed her Long List profile for Tokyo2020 last year, so it’s not super duper urgent.

"Well Shima,

“Thanks” for pushing this issue away from your Dept (Technical Support). A good technical support will follow the case thru till closure. Giving an unacceptable solution to a customer and close the issue is the way your Dept work. Anyway, Singapore style and government/semi government style. No choice. Good taichi. 

I sincerely hope one day a same or similar issue will falls onto you so that you can understand the frustration of the end user for the irresponsible act of the organization/company/Dept.

"Hi there

This email regarding the off peak gym pass that I purchased 6month validity, I’ve been trying to book a slot and realised there’s always no availability even though I intend to make an advance booking by at least 3-4 days. 

I’ve tried this for over a month yet I get the same result every time. Also, I only search for off peak timing but it’s always fully booked.

As such kindly process a full 40$ refund of my membership. 

Below are some details you may require:
Name: Lin Yanrong
NRIC: S9200957B
Membership: 6 month off peak at 40$

If you require further information regarding this you may contact me at 96618323.


Thank you

As i did not know until i was told today that if the booking was made under Person A then Person A have to be there and i have about 6 more bookings after today which i won’t be able to make it as the booking was not under my account which is my mother’s but the timings which i booked she would be busy. I didn’t read the bottom part of the receipt hence my mistake. I was told by the staff at Yio Chu Kang to email this email and get a refund for the courts that i’m unable to attend. So i’m here to discuss with what i should do about the 6 hours of courts i have left!

"Dear Sir/Mdm,

I understand that my ActiveSG account has been banned.

We have learnt from our mistakes the previous time and we promise to never
let it happen again.

We promise to respect other users and the staff.

I would very much like to use my ActiveSG again to sign up for a membership
at Anytime Fitness.

May I check when will the ban on my account be lifted so I can use them
again?

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you and have a great weekend ahead.

My initial payment of $15 using the ActiveSG Mobile App was met with technical difficulty at the cashier of Decathlon, which subsequently indicated that the payment was not successful. As the initial cashier indicated that the payment did not go through, I went to complete my purchase using my UOB One Credit Card at a different cashier.However, I was appalled to notice that a $15 had been deducted from my ActiveSG wallet when I was making a payment for a booking on the 26th March 2021. I am reaching out to ActiveSG to seek a refund of $15 to my ActiveSG wallet because I believe that ActiveSG proceeded with the transaction despite an error at the cashier of Decathlon. I have attached a copy of my ActiveSG receipt for the unauthorized charge and a screenshot of my UOB credit card charge for my purchase to sustain my claim.Kindly direct me to the correct authority if you believe that this issue cannot be resolved by ActiveSG, Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.Regards,Hao Jie

2020, Dec 2020, Jan 2021 and Feb 2021.



I have checked through their volunteering records and confirm that the
entries are accurate.

There are some volunteers whose name are not appearing in the master data
extracted by Puey Yee, however they have also clocked their required hours
as well.
I have attached the volunteering records of these affected volunteers to
support their payment.



For your approval please.

Thereafter, we would like to get Memberships’ teams help to load the MyCash

"hi there,

i tried to book for volleyball court on the 27th mar but keep having error
messages. then today i realised activesg actually charged me for all the
unsuccessful transactions..

can you please refund me for all these unsuccessful transactions? in the
end i used my credit card to book the court because activesg keep throwing
error.

this is very alarming and appalling as there is also no refund or message
from the system. and activesg just conveniently charged me for nothing
which is actually equivalent to cheating.
",Wallet
"Thank you for your acknowledgement.

Can you ask Farris what if error not rectify by 4th Apr which is the test
date , will they wait till error rectify then generate the certificate?

 I am quite disappointed that Farris don't reply to my email, please ask IT
service dept to expedite
my request and response to my email.


Best Regards
Ong Beng Teck

"Hi,

May I confirm if it’s 3 or 4 unmatched? I was charged 5 times of $14.80 on the 27th as shown in the photos I sent. Since the max I can book a day is 2hs, which is $14.80, that would mean 4 unmatched transactions. Could you please check again? Thank you.

"Hi why is my children being charged $1.70 for swimming at tpy pool. And why the adults are charged at $1.30?

Can you please correct this in the app. It’s annoying how I pay same price or more for kids when the app even knows the children’s birthdate. It’s really very frustrating especially when tpy pool doesn’t open the kids pool at the same time. 

Terrible service.

"Hi Azimah and team,

Thanks for checking. Let me summarise based on the transactions on 27th
March found in my bank account (total 13):

Unmatched transactions that will be refunded (total 10):
20210327RN002793 - 30.00
20210327RN002728 - 30.00
20210327RN002599 - 30.00
20210327RN002461 - 30.00
20210327RN002233 - 30.00
20210327RN002021 - 30.00
20210327RN001848 - 30.00
20210327RN001144 - 30
20210327RN000505 - 30
20210327RN000641 - 30

Transactions that are still unaccounted:
20210327RN000985 - 30
20210327RN001661 - 30
20210327RN003473  - 30

Understand 1 of the above is used to top up the activesg wallet. The other
2 transactions i'm not sure but i received 2 x $30 top up on 31st Mar so i
guess i can assume these are the refund from activesg?
Rev ICT 27032021 0390FR2102387 +30
Rev ICT 27032021 0390FR2102383 +30

If that's the case then kindly proceed to process the above 10 transactions
for refund.. thank you.

  This email seeks your assistance on an account issue that I have with
ActiveSG.

  I had tried to make a booking for a tennis wall, however, I was unable to
do so as I had forgotten my pin number. The app then suggested that I reset
my PIN through the computer which I did. I then found out that my ActiveSG
account was linked to an email that no longer exists.

  Hence, now I am stuck in this situation where I have no way to use the
money in my account, nor can I change my linked email address.

Hi,

May I confirm if it’s 3 or 4 unmatched? I was charged 5 times of $14.80 on the 27th as shown in the photos I sent. Since the max I can book a day is 2hs, which is $14.80, that would mean 4 unmatched transactions. Could you please check again? Thank you.

"Hi!

Thank you for your clarification! But isn’t this a little ridiculous as it was a mistake and i really can’t make it, shouldn’t i be allowed to cancel it and let it to someone who really wants to use it? 

Is there a way to manually cancel on your side? Or will i get penalised for not turning up? 

Thanks and Regards

Because if your child is already 15 years old and have gotten his physical ID, he will need register with Singpass first, wait for at least 1 day for Singpass to update his profile and data and then re-login to his ActiveSG account and verify him account via  Singpass.

Please make your app developers to do something on the app.. I’ve trying hard to book a gym slot almost for the past week yet none to book. Very frustrated with the app systems.
App keeps auto refreshing, auto restart.. what is this?! I believed the app crashes due to many people trying to book, this is not the answers!! 
Since the above aged (seniors) mostly gets free entry, why not make a segregated timings from 11am onwards for them to get slots booking as most of us beyond that age limits could go gym at 11am & before. 
C’mon ActiveSG you could simply restructured this timings & segregated the time slots. 

Hope ActiveSG could rectify this issue ASAP and not keep delaying, making others get frustrated just over for slot bookings at 7am & 9am.

  Re: [CASE:221928] ActiveSG $100 credit Hi,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.


 Account verification is necessary to claim the ActiveSG $100 credits, to be eligible for local rates, and to be able to book facilities 15 days in advance.

All members aged 16 years old and above are required to verify their accounts via SingPass, and may first register a SingPass at these locations: https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/common/counter

To verify your ActiveSG account, please follow the steps below.

1. Login (existing user) ->Profile -> ME -> Verify my account

Please logout and login again if you're unable to see the credits.

For those aged 15 and below, please proceed to any ActiveSG sports centre or swimming pool to verify the account with the birth certificate.


Please take note that the complementary ActiveSG $100 credits will expire on the 31st of December of the following year upon verification of the ActiveSG account and the validity date can only be extended with usage of the credits via purchases of gym/swim passes, Sports Centre bookings, etc.

"Dear whom may it concern,

Last week, I had booked a badminton facility at Woodlands Secondary School
and received a confirmation on my booking with receipt no 20210327RC003937.

However, in the process of booking and due to issues with the ActiveSG
portal, there were additional transactions made and were deducted from my
account. The transaction numbers are listed as follows.

20210327RN000408 ($14.80)
20210327RN000561 ($14.80)
20210327RN000743 ($14.80)
20210327RN001447 ($14.80)
20210327RN002012 ($14.80) (already reimbursed)
20210327RN002252 ($14.80)
20210327RN002455 ($30)
20210327RN002700 ($14.80)
20210327RN002906 ($30)

20210327RN003196 ($30)
20210327RN003273 ($30)

The eventual booking was made by myself topping up $30 with receipt no
20210327RC003846
and paid by receipt no 20210327RN003937 for $14.80.

I have also attached screenshots to this email for reference.

" Hi,The vending machine at CCK stadium took $1.80 without dispensing anything. Column 35 was available for selection but was actually empty, which I selected on accident. After keying in the Wallet PIN for the wrong drink selection, $1.80 had been taken. I shouldn’t be paying for something I didn’t get! The images supporting the faulty transaction have been attached. 
And by the way, I have yet to receive refund for the Cardiomix programme cancelled last year during Circuit Breaker period, despite speaking to one of the staff over the phone! You people seem to be doing nothing to follow up! Kindly do something about the refund for the  $1.80 taken by the vending machine, and the money yet to be credited for cancellation of Cardiomix class!

We have checked and your son is already 15 years old. He will only be able to verify his account using SingPass. May we advise to contact SingPass to expedite the issuing of your child's SingPass account. After attaining the SingPass account, your son will be able to verify his account via the following steps:

"Hi
I am frequent user of ActiveSG 
App to book gym facilities. 

The app always hang, from navigating, to launching, to before booking, a terrible “I’m not robot”. After that it will hang, and I have to retry again after time out. When I finally reached the dates/slots, when I select my prefer time slot , it always says “slot available/sorry not available slots”, even though I see the slots available. 

After closing and open the apps.finally repeat the process. The prefer slots are all taken. The whole process takes 10 mins just to book a gym slot. 

This is very terrible UIUX experience. The promoting of ActiceSg using the apps is not pleasant process having to deal with using a poorly developed app. 

May I Seek your feedback and how to resolve this? Will other users face these issues and If there Are community sharing with similar experience? I have spoken to many users at the gym. And all have the same experience.

"Pls feed back to the management.

I find that the suspension has caused me to booked those advanced sessions
to have missed out the time and venue, hence, the past three days of what I
have booked plus today, I am not sure of the time and venue, hence I have
missed these training sessions, am I gonna get suspended again?

Suspension can't even log-in to the account makes it weirder, I hope we can
access our account and management do something abt this.

Thanks
Justin

"Hi,

Appreciate if you could help me with this :)

I understand it's possible to use the credits to book Facilities like
volleyball courts (e.g. Hougang Primary School Hall)

[image: image.png]

But when I reach the payment page, there's no option to use ActiveSG
credits. I still have $88 ActiveSG credits left in my account.

[image: image.png]



So instead I topped up my eWallet - MyCash and proceeded with the
transaction/booking facility.

The screenshot below is after I made the payment with MyCash. Now it shows
the ActiveSG $ credit remaining.
[image: image.png]


For future Facility Bookings, how do I make payment with my ActiveSG $
credits?

Thank you!

It seems an issue of app rather than verification of information.

So efficient system that I need to physically go there to reset my password.

Come on.. this is 2021 , not 1993...

"I would like to file a report regarding the event that had happened last night at woodlands gym around 7 to 8:40 time slot. I wasn't actually aware that I was the one getting bullied by a couple of guys behind me. I was focusing on my exercise and I thought they were just teasing each other. But a friend of mine told me that I was actually the one they making fun of. One guy in a blue shirt with a black waistband even gesture a butt move to his friend who's wearing a green tank top.Please review the CCTV around that time slot and kindly take action regarding this, therefore, it won't happen again to other girls working out in the gym. If possible I would like to request a meeting which will be held on your premises with the parties involved.

Hi,The vending machine at CCK stadium took $1.80 without dispensing anything. Column 35 was available for selection but was actually empty, which I selected on accident. After keying in the Wallet PIN for the wrong drink selection, $1.80 had been taken. I shouldn’t be paying for something I didn’t get! The images supporting the faulty transaction have been attached. 
And by the way, I have yet to receive refund for the Cardiomix programme cancelled last year during Circuit Breaker period, despite speaking to one of the staff over the phone! You people seem to be doing nothing to follow up! Kindly do something about the refund for the  $1.80 taken by the vending machine, and the money yet to be credited for cancellation of Cardiomix class!
